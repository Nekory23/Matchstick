# Matchstick

{EPITECH} | First year | Elementary programming in C project

This project is based on a very famous game based on matchsticks.
There is a certain number of matchstick lines.
The two players take turns; each player can, on a same line, take one or several matchsticks.
The losing player is the one to take the last matchstick.

The goal of the project is to create a program that you can play against.
The basic version must generate a game board with n matchstick lines (1 < n < 100) and have a simple interface 
so that the user could play against the computer.

The number of lines is given as parameter to the program.
The second parameter of the program indicates the maximum number of matches that can be taken out each turn (must be > 0).
When matchsticks are removed, they must be removed starting from the right (like in the example below).
The user will always start the game.
